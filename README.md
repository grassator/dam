Small AMD loader designed for inlining into the page â€“ just ~1.1Kb (~640 bytes gzipped). It has original `require.js`-compatible API and should be a stand-in replacement if you don't require advanced features like plugins, paths or shims. 

## Usage

Add inline script from the minified file from the `dist` folder into your page. Then in your code you can use regular `require` / `define` functions:

```js
require(['your-dependency'], function (yourDependency) {
    // your code
});
```

or

```js
define(['your-dependency'], function (yourDependency) {
    // your code
});
```

## Supported Features

* Named modules
* Anonymous modules
* `baseUrl` config

## Browser Support

* Evergreen (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Edge)
* IE9+

## Error Codes

To save bytes iamdee does not include moduleError message strings and
instead uses moduleError codes. Meaning of each code is presented below:

1. define() call without id only works when script is loaded via require().
2. require()'d module must not have id in its define() statement or match
the one specified in the requesting require() statement.
3. Synchronous require of the form `const foo = require("foo")` is only allowed for already loaded modules.
4. Module loading failed because its dependency failed to load. The name of the failed dependency is written after the error code.
5. Failed to load the script. Usually this indicates a network or a security policy error.
