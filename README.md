Small AMD loader designed for inlining into the page â€“ just ~1.1Kb (~640 bytes gzipped). It has original `require.js`-compatible API and should be a stand-in replacement if you don't require advanced features like plugins, paths or shims. 

## Usage

Add inline script from the minified file from the `dist` folder into your page. Then in your code you can use regular `require` / `define` functions:

```js
require(['your-dependency'], function (yourDependency) {
    // your code
});
```

or

```js
define(['your-dependency'], function (yourDependency) {
    // your code
});
```

## Supported Features

* Named modules
* Anonymous modules
* `baseUrl` config

## Browser Support

* Evergreen (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Edge)
* IE9+
